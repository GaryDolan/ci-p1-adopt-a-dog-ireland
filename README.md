# User Experience

## Initial Discussion
Adopt-a-Dog Ireland is a website that I (Gary Dolan) developed for my first project as part of Code Institutes Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. The websites target audience is people interested in adopting a dog in Ireland. It was designed to allow prospective dog adopters to browser a catalogue of adoptable dogs. The website will provide the user with all the adoptable dogs details and also guide the user through the adoption process. It will allow the user to apply to adopt a dog of their choice.

[Adopt-a-Dog Ireland Website](https://garydolan.github.io/ci-p1-adopt-a-dog-ireland/)


Adopt-a-Dog Ireland is a website that I (Gary Dolan) developed for my first project as part of Code Institutes Diploma in Full Stack Software Development. The website was created for people looking to adopt dogs in Ireland and was designed to allow prospective dog adopters to browser a catalogue of adoptable dogs. The websites will providing the user with the all the adoptable dogs details and also guide the user through the adoption process. It will allow the user to apply to adopt a dog of their choice.

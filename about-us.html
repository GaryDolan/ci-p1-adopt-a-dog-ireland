                <p>Adopt a Dog Ireland is a family owned and operated dog shelter. It is owned and operated by the Dolan family. The main reason we started our shelter was because we love Dogs, always have, always will. We establish Adopt-a-Dog Ireland in 2023 in the efforts to help house as many dogs as possible. We wanted to make a shelter and accompanying website to make the process of adopting a dog fun and simple. We pride ourselves on the ability to find the perfect dog to match your lifestyle. At Adopt-a-Dog Ireland we try our utmost to ensure that the process of dog adoption is as effortless as possible. We want you to enjoy every stage of the process and for you to get your new best friend home with no stress involved.</p>
